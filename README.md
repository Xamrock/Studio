# Xamrock Studio

Xamrock Studio is a macOS application that streamlines iOS UI test automation by turning manual app interactions into executable test code. Record your app flows visually on iOS simulators or physical devices, and instantly generate test scripts for XCUITest, Maestro, or Appium; eliminating the tedious process of writing repetitive UI test code by hand.
